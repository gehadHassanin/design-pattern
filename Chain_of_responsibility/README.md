# Chain of Responsibility
The Chain of Responsibility design pattern is a behavioral design pattern that allows an object to pass a request along a chain of handlers. Each handler in the chain decides either to process the request or to pass it along the chain to the next handler.
This pattern encourages loose coupling between sender and receiver, providing freedom in handling the request.

# Characteristics of the Chain of Responsibility Design Pattern
### Loose Coupling: 
This means the sender of a request doesn't need to know which specific object will handle it. Similarly, the handler doesn’t need to understand how the requests are sent. This keeps the components separate and flexible.

### Dynamic Chain: 
While the program is running, changing the chain is simple. This makes your code incredibly flexible because you may add or delete handlers without changing the main body of the code.

### Single Responsibility Principle: 
Each handler in the chain has one job: either to handle the request or to pass it to the next handler. This keeps the code organized and focused, making it easier to manage.

### Sequential Order: 
Requests move through the chain one at a time. Each handler gets a chance to process the request in a specific order, ensuring consistency.

### Fallback Mechanism: 
If a request isn’t handled by any of the handlers, the chain can include a fallback option. This means there's a default way to deal with requests that don't fit anywhere else.

# Disadvantages of the Chain of Responsibility
### Possible Unhandled Requests: 
The chain should be implemented correctly otherwise there is a chance that some requests might not get handled at all, which leads to unexpected behavior in the application.
### Performance Overhead: 
The request will go through several handlers in the chain if it is lengthy and complicated, which could cause performance overhead. The processing logic of each handler has an effect on the system's overall performance.
### Complexity in Debugging: 
The fact that the chain has several handlers can make debugging more difficult. Tracking the progression of a request and determining which handler is in charge of handling it can be difficult.
### Runtime Configuration Overhead: 
It may become more difficult to manage and maintain the chain of responsibility if the chain is dynamically modified at runtime.
